    <h1>Hi Albee Account & Data Deletion</h1>

    <p>
        Hi Albee gives users full control over their personal data. You may delete your entire account 
        or remove specific data directly within the app at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>Delete Your Entire Account</h2>
    <p>
        Deleting your account permanently removes all associated data.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Delete Your Account</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the Hi Albee app</li>
        <li>Go to <strong>Profile Settings</strong></li>
        <li>Tap <strong>“Delete Account and All Data”</strong></li>
        <li>Confirm your deletion request</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>What Is Deleted</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Account information (including email and user ID)</li>
        <li>Chat history and reflections</li>
        <li>Insights and reports</li>
        <li>Enneagram responses</li>
        <li>Preference and familiarity data</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
    </p>

    <h2>Delete Individual Data (Without Deleting Your Account)</h2>
    <p>
        You may also delete specific data while keeping your account active.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Individual chat conversations can be deleted within the chat interface.</li>
        <li>Selected stored data can be removed through the <strong>“My Data”</strong> section in Profile Settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Deleting individual data removes it from active user storage and prevents it from being used 
        in future insights or functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Some limited technical logs (such as anonymized server logs or crash logs) may be retained 
        temporarily for security, fraud prevention, and system integrity purposes. These logs are 
        automatically deleted within a limited retention period and are not used for advertising 
        or tracking.
    </p>
